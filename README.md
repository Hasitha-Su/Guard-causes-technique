# Guard Clauses Example

A simple JavaScript code snippet to demonstrate the use of guard clauses in function execution. The code consists of two different techniques to handle function conditions: using guard clauses and without using guard clauses.

Guard clause technique is a programming pattern used to simplify complex nested conditional statements by returning early from a function when certain conditions are met. This approach improves code readability, reduces indentation levels, and makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

## Features

- Two variations of the `micro_controller_connect` function
- With and without guard clauses
- Clear and concise demonstration of the differences between the two techniques

## Usage

Copy the code snippets into your JavaScript project or run them in a browser console.
